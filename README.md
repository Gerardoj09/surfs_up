## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy analyse weather information throughout the year in order to know if it is sustainable to start a Surf & Ice cream business in Oahu.

## Results
### The three major points from both analyses were the following:
#### Consiedering the records from the last year of the provided data, the most rising temperature is usually in the early second half of the year. 
#### The standard deviation regarding temperature from June and December is pretty stable which is quite interesting considering that the first is the month of transition from spring to summer, and the second is the month of transition from fall and winter. 
#### Although June and December are 6 months apart, their temperatures in Oahu are similar in the mean. The maximum temperature between those months is practically the same; the biggest difference regarding temperatur is between their mimimum temperatures and that difference is only 8Â°F.

## Summary
### Another two queries that I consider imporant to perform would be the precipitation and temperature from 10 years back till the most recent date possible, also comparing those results with every month of the year over that period of time to detect possible trends or variations over the years, to extrapolate future conditions. That would provide a future scope of the sustainability of the business based on future possible scenarios rather than past ones. For sure results will vary.
